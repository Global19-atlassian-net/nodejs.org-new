# nodejs.org v2

This repo has been created for retrieving the community's feedback on the next design of our website.

Please note that it only exists for the purpose of collecting everyone's opinions and hosting project files and assets of the design. Once the design is ready, the development work will continue on the [existing repo](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org).

## Administration

The process of designing the next site is currently being lead by [@leo](https://github.com/leo). However, we might add more contributors who're able to access the project files as occasion arises.
